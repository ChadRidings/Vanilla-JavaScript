                                The present book proposes a new descriptive model, the so called "Ideation Model" (IM),
                                of the design process from a dual cognitive-engineering perspective, partly,based on
                                existing models from both fields and previous work performed. The model, addresses the
                                issue of modeling the ideation or the front-end phase of the, engineering design/product
                                development process, representing the interface of cognitive psychology and engineering
                                design. Three domains - inspiration, decomposition and integration - and three spaces -
                                problem-space, idea-space and,concept-space are considered as elements of the model.
